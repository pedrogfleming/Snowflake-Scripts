-- 1. Query from the previously created JSON_RAW  table.

-- Note: This table was created in the previous assignment (assignment 7) where you had to create a stage object that is pointing to 's3://snowflake-assignments-mc/unstructureddata/'.
-- We have called the table JSON_RAW.

select * from EXERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.JSON_RAW;

-- 2. Select the attributes

-- first_name

-- last_name

-- skills

-- and query these columns.

select 
    Raw:first_name,
    Raw:last_name,
    Raw:Skills
from EXERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.JSON_RAW;

-- 2. The skills column contains an array. Query the first two values in the skills attribute for every record in a separate column:

-- first_name

-- last_name

-- skills_1

-- skills_2



-- 3. Create a table and insert the data for these 4 columns in that table.


CREATE TABLE json_parse(
    first_name string,
    last_name string,
    skill_1 string,
    skill_2 string
) AS
select 
    Raw:first_name,
    Raw:last_name,
    Raw:Skills[0],
    Raw:Skills[1]
from EXERCISE_DB.PUBLIC.JSON_RAW;
