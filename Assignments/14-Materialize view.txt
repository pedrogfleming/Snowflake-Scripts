-- Create a materialized view called PARTS in the database DEMO_DB from the following statement:

-- SELECT 
-- AVG(PS_SUPPLYCOST) as PS_SUPPLYCOST_AVG,
-- AVG(PS_AVAILQTY) as PS_AVAILQTY_AVG,
-- MAX(PS_COMMENT) as PS_COMMENT_MAX
-- FROM"SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA"."TPCH_SF100"."PARTSUPP"
-- Execute the SELECT before creating the materialized view and note down the time until the query is executed. ->
-- PS_SUPPLYCOST_AVG	PS_AVAILQTY_AVG	PS_COMMENT_MAX
